Opentrek is an experimental project designed to build a community around outdoor activities. Our initial focus is on running and walking activities, offering users a decentralized ecosystem of tools to track and share their performance. Users can run their own relay or use a friend's relay to store their activity data, which can be shared with the entire community.

# Technology Stack
Opentrek utilizes a diverse set of technologies:
- **Nostr** for the relay concept. Nostr is a protocol for creating a resilient, tamperproof "social" network that doesn't rely on any central server or P2P techniques.
- **Mapbox** and a custom version of **Tegola** for map functionalities.
- **Flutter** for cross-device application delivery.

# Installation
To run Opentrek, you need a k3s cluster. Apply the `deployment.yaml` to your cluster to run all components of Opentrek.

# Usage
After installing Opentrek, you can import your outdoor activity data into the system using the provided sample notebook. The data can then be visualized in the front-end application, which currently features a sample HTML page.
